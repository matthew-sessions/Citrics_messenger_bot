# Citrics Bot

I spent the last two years working abroad in Shenzhen, China. I worked for a company that owned a couple dozen e-commerce platforms and a few OEM Brands. Being one of two foreigners working in a mid-size Chinese company, my role was “to make things better across all platforms, products, and brands”. Needless to say I had a lot of responsibilities. The 996 work culture in China can be tiring; and 12 hour days can take a toll on your mental health, but this lifestyle gave me the opportunity to independently make high impact business decisions on a weekly basis.
One of the high impact decisions I made was to implement a Messenger Marketing Strategy for each and every one of our platforms and brands. I spent months training various marketing departments how to use third-party Bot services like Manychat and Chatfuel. I taught them how to run JSON ads and bring down the cost per-click while maintaining the ability to retarget in a more direct way. I help them build flows that delivered unique Amazon Coupons. I also helped them link Messenger flows to QR codes to bring offline store traffic into the digital space. I became passionate about the Messenger Ecosystem and the endless number of business optimizations it offered. 
After a few months of developing simple business bots I had the idea of “Dynamically generated content”. I wanted to create an engine that relied on user feedback to continually generate relevant content.
CitricsBot is a proof of concept for Dynamic Content. All of the charts that are rendered via the CitricsBot flow do not exist until the user requests them.
